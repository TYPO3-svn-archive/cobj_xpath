Introduction

What does it do?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This extension adds a new content object XPATH to the classic
TypoScript cObjects. The XPATH cObject allows for a flexible,
TypoScript based treatment of any kind of XML data. The data can be
read from database fields, files or external resources.

Features
^^^^^^^^

- TypoScript based approach to XML processing

- Many possibilities to work on the XML data with stdWrap or parseFunc

- Works with database fields, files or external XML resources

- Get values from TYPO3 Flexforms or Gridelements with TypoScript

- Offers different return formats for the results matched by the XPath query

- Debug errors with the TSFE admin panel

Many things can be realized like chaining of XPATH objects or
transformation of the XML data either with TypoScript, PHP (userFuncs)
or `XSLT <http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/cobj_xslt>`_ .
Have a look at the tutorials in this manual.

of the `Digital Academy Mainz <http://www.digitale-akademie.de/>`_
where we have to deal with lots of XML. Glad if you find it
useful too.
